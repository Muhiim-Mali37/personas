        <p>
            For the personas and storyboarding project, our task is to observe real
            users interacting with an interface, interview these individuals about their experiences, create personas
            based
            on these users, and illustrate a storyboard for one of our personas.

        <p> I chose a washing machine that is located in the basement of Harkness as my interface. It is in the public
            view and accessible to everyone. The interface is used to wash any type of clothes using soap and water. Its
            main components include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detergent drawer, which contains the detergent, softener, and bleach </li>
            <li>The door, which is where the clothes are placed</li>
            <li>Control panel settings, which is used to set the settings for the wash.</li>
        </ul>
